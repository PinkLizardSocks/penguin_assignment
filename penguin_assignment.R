## Script name: penguin_assignment.r
##
## Purpose of script: 
##      Loads penguin data, cleans it, runs a chi squared test of independence 
##      for species and island, plots the results, and saves the plot to a file

# Run a chi-squared test on the data

chisq.test(penguins_subset$species, penguins_subset$island)

# The results are a X-squared value of 299.55 with 4 df and a p value < 2.2e-16
# This strongly indicates that island and species are not independent 
# The proportions of penguins on each island are significantly different 

# Check the assumptions of the chi squared test by observing the expected frequencies

write.table(expected_frequencies_table, "figures/expected_frequency_table.csv")

# The resulting table found in the figures file shows that each expected 
# frequency is greater than 5 so this assumption is not violated. 
# Other assumptions of independence, categorical variables, and mutually 
# exclusive categories are also met.
